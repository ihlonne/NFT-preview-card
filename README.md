## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I didn't necessarily learn something new in this project, but it undoubtedly helped to solidifying my knowledge about flexbox as I did struggle with part of the design.


### Continued development

I'm not entirely comfortable using flexbox still and I will need to continue working on it. I have yet to include grid into my own code and look forward to include it in my projects going forward.
